World War II (WWII) was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world's nations. It emerged from unresolved tensions following World War I, economic instability, and the rise of aggressive ideologies like fascism and militarism.

The war saw two major opposing military alliances: the Allies, led by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, among others, and the Axis powers, primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan. It can be divided into two main theaters: the European Theater and the Pacific Theater.

In Europe, the conflict began with Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939, triggering responses from Britain and France. Germany swiftly conquered much of Western Europe in 1940, but the Battle of Britain marked a turning point as the Royal Air Force defended against German air attacks. The Eastern Front saw intense fighting between Germany and the Soviet Union, with pivotal battles like Stalingrad and Kursk.

In the Pacific, Japan's expansionist ambitions led to its invasion of China in 1937 and the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, bringing the United States into the war. Japan rapidly expanded across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, facing significant resistance from Allied forces.

Key events of WWII include the Holocaust, in which millions of Jews and others were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany, and the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in August 1945.

WWII resulted in significant loss of life, with estimates of over 70 million fatalities worldwide. It also led to profound geopolitical changes, including the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers, the beginning of the Cold War, and the establishment of the United Nations to prevent future conflicts.

The war's aftermath also saw advancements in technology, medicine, and international cooperation, shaping the post-war world order and influencing global politics, economics, and society for decades to come.
