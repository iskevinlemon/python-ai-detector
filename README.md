# AI Detector with Python
Detect potentially AI written texts using Python.

## How it works
The program works by comparing the target <code>text.txt</code> 
file against a list of 100 keywords commonly used by AI (E.g. ChatGPT), the initial publication of the list can be found [here](https://twitter.com/skalskip92/status/1773027055673712916).

## Current potential flaw observed
As AI grows and learns, AI might change the way it structure its words, and the list of 100 keywords commonly used by AI may no longer be applicable.
